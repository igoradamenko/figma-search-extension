# figma-search-extension

Search though Figma objects even in “View only” mode.

## How to install

We're waiting for the extension being published in Chrome Web Store. So it's impossible to install it from there for now.

But you can download the repo and install the extension as ”unpacked”:

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
   The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over “More Tools” then selecting “Extensions”.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to “Developer mode”.
3. Click the “Load Unpacked” button and select the extension directory.

## TODO

- Improve icon
- Add separate icon for arrow?
- Fix polygon icon and others
- Optimize component & component set icons (duplicates)
- Remember last search?
- Hide console.logs behind `debug` option
- `ё` → `е` replacement? Special symbols ignoring?
